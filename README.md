# License Header Manager for Visual Studio


Manage license headers for your source code files in Visual Studio.

New files will automatically include the license headers defined in the current project.

License Header Manager allows you to:

* Define license headers per Visual Studio project and per file extension
* Share license headers between projects via "Add as Link"
* Add, remove and replace headers at any time for one or all files
* Put your license headers in #regions
* Use [Expendable Properties](https://github.com/rubicon-oss/LicenseHeaderManager/wiki/Expendable-Properties) like %FileName%, %Project% or %UserName% and many more, which are automatically filled everytime the Header is reinserted
